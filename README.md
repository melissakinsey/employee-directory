# DESCRIPTION
This tool [does this] using [these languages and technologies. 
![picture-of-app](assets/screenshot.png)

## Project Repo & Demo
The [code for this budget tracker](https://github.com/melissakinsey/budget-tracker) is housed on GitHub.  
		
## User Story
*AS A* budget-conscious saver and frequent traveler *I WANT TO* enter deposits and withdrawals even when I'm offline *SO I CAN* manage my transactions without interruption.	
	
## Usage
To use this app, enter a deposit or a withdrawal in online or offline mode. If you're offline, your transaction will sync next time you have an internet connection. To see how the tracker works, watch this quick [video demo](https://youtu.be/loremipsum).

# TECHNICAL SPECS
* Runs on the command line. 
* Uses MongoDB Atlas for offline storage. 
* Uses a service worker to communicate in an offline environment.
* Uses a manifest.json file to tell the browser how to display the budget tracker. This file includes the name of the app, the icons used, and the URL at which the app lives.
	
# LESSONS LEARNED 
This project was good for learning about using the dev tools. I'd already been using the 'Inspect Elements' panel in styling my projects, but now I know how to use the dev tools to simulate throttling and offline mode. I also learned about service worker files and manifest.json files.

# CONTRIBUTIONS
This was an individual project. Thanks, as always, to my study group and TAs!
